infiniteMonkey.py - basic program to iteratively generate random sentences and compare them to a desired string
letterlist.py - various exercises that involve taking a given list of words and creating a list containing their individual characters
infMonkeyThm/ - directory housing project expanding on 'infiniteMonkey.py'. Expansion is based on a hill-climbing algorithm. Code runs, but unit tests need to be written in order to verify correct operation of all parts. This work is currently on hold: research and teaching take up most of my current bandwidth, and I want to continue forward through Ranum and Miller instead of pausing for uncertain period of time in order to tinker on one of the challenges.
